INTRO:

  tknet (originally named twnet) is a simple-oriented cross-platform P2P library especially aimed at low cost embedded systems.

  tknet uses traditional centralized server-based model. However, differing from other P2P applications, the main feature of tknet enables tknet maintainers to use e-mail servers to track new tknet center P2P servers (namely bridge peer or BDG peer) lest others are broken down.

BUILD:

  STEP 1: Scons(see http://www.scons.org/) is required for building , please download tools related before first building the project. OpenSSL-dev library are also required if you want to enable the SSL feature.

  STEP 2: Run the './tknet.sh build' command in the tknet directory , executable files and tknet binary library are created under ./bin folder.

TEST:

  STEP 1: Run the './tknet.sh test' command to start a local test environment in console. (A Gnome enviornment is required, otherwise, you need to 'cd' to the ./test/bin directory and open each directory with a new console instead of doing this STEP)

  STEP 2: Run the 'demo' program in each console from dir0 to dir3, you will eventually see 'Connection started' prompts in dir1 and dir3 consoles.

  STEP 3: Now, you can type words in one of the two consoles to send the words to another.
  
NOTE: 
  
  1: Run the './tknet.sh win' to generate the DOS format source codes.

  2: Use 'help' command in 'demo' to see more implemented commands.(you need to do this before connection)

  3: An implementation code demo.c is provided under the ./test folder, to illustrate a simple chatting implementation.
