INTRO:

  tknet (originally named twnet) is a simple-oriented cross-platform P2P library especially aimed at low cost embedded systems.

  tknet uses traditional centralized server-based service model. However, differing from other P2P applications, the main feature of tknet enables tknet maintainers to use e-mail servers to track new tknet center P2P servers(namely bridge peer or BDG peer) when others are closed down.
  The aim of tknet is to provide binary libraries available for developers to achieve funcions mentioned above, implementation codes(demo.c) can be found under the ./test folder.

BUILD:

  STEP 1: tknet is built using Scons (see http://www.scons.org/) , please download tools related before first build the project. OpenSSL dev library are also required if you want to enable the SSL feature.
  STEP 2: run the './tknet.sh buildall' command in tknet directory , executable file are created under ./bin folder.

TEST:

  run the './tknet.sh test' command to start a local test environment . type 'help' command in console before connection to see other implemented commands .
  Detailed ways of using tknet please send me an email: clock126@126.com .

  I am still a student now , I WANT to write a fully documented project, but I don't have time to in this holiday.
