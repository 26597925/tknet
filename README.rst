INTRO:                             
======
tknet is designed to become a simple cross-platform P2P library.

tknet uses traditional centralized-server-based model, however, different from other P2P solutions, tknet peer is able to use Email server to track center servers (namely bridge peers or BDG peers) when necessary. It uses a private protocol and is still under development. Despite these, it works and it is simple.

If you are interested in this project, please let me know! I need some incentive to let tknet go further.
